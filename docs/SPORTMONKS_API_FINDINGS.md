## üó∫Ô∏è Data Mapping Strategy

### Your Current Database ‚Üí Sports Monks API

#### Competitions Mapping

| Your DB | Competition Name | Sports Monks League ID | Status |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Premier League | 8 | ‚úÖ Confirmed |
| 2 | Champions League | TBD | üîç Need to find |
| 3 | FA Cup | TBD | üîç Need to find |
| 4 | EFL Cup | TBD | üîç Need to find |
| 5 | Europa League | TBD | üîç Need to find |
| 6 | Conference League | TBD | üîç Need to find |
| ... | Other leagues | TBD | üîç Need to find |

**Next Step:** Query all leagues and create full mapping table

#### TV Stations/Providers Mapping

Your providers table currently has:
- ID 1: Sky Sports
- ID 2: TNT Sports
- ID 3: BBC
- ID 4: Amazon Prime
- ID 999: Blackout

**Sports Monks provides 59+ broadcasters per fixture!** We need to:
1. Query all unique TV stations from Sports Monks
2. Filter for UK broadcasters
3. Map to your existing provider IDs
4. Add new providers if needed

#### Teams Mapping

- Your teams table has `id`, `name`, `slug`
- Sports Monks fixtures provide team names in fixture.name
- Need to extract and match teams by name similarity
- Create `api_team_mapping` table for Sports Monks ID ‚Üî Your ID

---

## üìã Next Steps - Priority Order

### 1. Complete League Mapping (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
# Create script to:
# - Fetch all leagues
# - Find Champions League, FA Cup, etc.
# - Create mapping table in database
```

### 2. Build TV Stations Mapper (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
# Create script to:
# - Fetch all unique TV stations from Sports Monks
# - Filter for UK broadcasters (Sky, TNT, BBC, Amazon, etc.)
# - Map to existing provider IDs
# - Store unmapped stations for review
```

### 3. Create Sync Pipeline (CORE FEATURE)
```bash
# Build automated sync:
# 1. Fetch fixtures for next 7 days
# 2. Get TV stations for each fixture
# 3. Map to your database schema
# 4. Update broadcasts table
# 5. Log sync results
```

### 4. Add Feature Flags
```javascript
// Feature flags for gradual rollout:
ENABLE_SPORTMONKS_SYNC: false ‚Üí true
ENABLE_LIVE_SCORES: false ‚Üí true
ENABLE_LINEUPS: false ‚Üí true
```

### 5. Build Admin Interface
- Connection test button
- Manual sync trigger
- View sync logs
- API usage stats
- Provider mapping review

- [ ] Find all competition IDs
- [ ] Create league mapping table
- [ ] Map TV stations to providers
- [ ] Test data sync (dry run)

### Phase 2: Sync Pipeline (Next Week)

- **After:** 10 minutes/week monitoring sync
- **Annual Savings:** ~150 hours

### Data Quality
- **Before:** Manual entry, potential errors
- **After:** Automated, consistent, 59+ broadcasters per match

### New Capabilities
- Real-time live scores
- Team lineups
- Match statistics

## üîß Technical Notes

### Rate Limiting
- **Limit:** 3000 requests/hour
- **Current:** Built-in rate limiter with 200ms delay
- **Monitoring:** Track usage in admin panel
- **Safety:** Cache responses for 5 minutes

### Caching Strategy
- Fixtures: 5 minutes
- TV Stations: 5 minutes
- Livescores: 30 seconds (real-time)
- Leagues: 1 hour (rarely changes)

### Error Handling
- API down ‚Üí Fall back to manual entry
- Rate limit hit ‚Üí Wait and retry
- Invalid data ‚Üí Log and skip
- Mapping miss ‚Üí Alert admin

## üìö Useful API Patterns

### Get Fixtures with TV Stations
```javascript
// Step 1: Get fixtures
const fixtures = await GET('/fixtures/date/2025-10-02');

// Step 2: For each fixture, get TV stations
for (const fixture of fixtures) {
  const tvStations = await GET(`/tv-stations/fixtures/${fixture.id}`);
  // Map and save
}
```

### Get Live Scores
```javascript
// Poll every 30 seconds during live matches
const liveMatches = await GET('/livescores/inplay');
// Update database with latest scores
```

### Get Team Lineups
```javascript
// 1 hour before kickoff
const lineups = await GET(`/lineups/fixtures/${fixtureId}`);
// Display on match page
```
