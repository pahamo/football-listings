## Recent Improvements (September 2025)

### Code Quality & Performance
- ✅ **Removed legacy code**: Eliminated duplicate AdminPage.tsx (718 lines)
- ✅ **Performance optimization**: Fixed window object access in FixtureCard component with CSS media queries
- ✅ **Production cleanup**: Removed console.log statements from services layer
- ✅ **Dependency updates**: Updated TypeScript 4.9→5.3, web-vitals 2.1→3.6, testing libraries
- ✅ **Unused code removal**: Cleaned up unused dependencies (@types/jest, cross-fetch, whatwg-url)

### Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Responsive design**: FixtureCard now uses CSS media queries instead of JavaScript window checks
- ✅ **SSR compatibility**: Eliminated client-side window access for better server-side rendering
- ✅ **Better separation**: Maintained clean separation between supabase.ts and supabase-simple.ts services

### Security Fixes
- ✅ **Zero vulnerabilities**: Resolved all 9 security vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high)
- ✅ **Package overrides**: Used npm overrides to force secure versions of vulnerable dependencies
- ✅ **Updated components**: nth-check ^2.1.1, postcss ^8.4.47, webpack-dev-server ^5.2.2
- ✅ **Build compatibility**: All fixes maintain full backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Multi-Competition Platform (September 2025)
- ✅ **Competition Overview**: New `/competitions` page with interactive cards for all live competitions
- ✅ **Individual Competition Pages**: Dedicated dashboards at `/competitions/[slug]` with fixtures and stats
- ✅ **Enhanced Navigation**: Dropdown menu with hover functionality for easy competition access
- ✅ **Multi-Competition Fixtures**: Default fixtures page shows all leagues with filtering capability
- ✅ **Competition Badges**: Visual indicators on club pages showing which competition each match belongs to
- ✅ **SEO Optimization**: All pages updated for multi-competition content with improved search visibility

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Public vs Admin Data Visibility

### Public Website Restrictions
**The public website must NOT display:**
- Total fixture counts or statistics
- Number of confirmed/pending broadcasts
- Blackout game counts
- Internal broadcast assignment metrics
- Any data that reveals incomplete fixture coverage

### Admin-Only Information
**These statistics should ONLY appear in admin areas:**
- Competition statistics (total fixtures, confirmed broadcasts, blackouts, pending)
- Broadcast assignment progress indicators
- Internal data completeness metrics
- Editorial workflow information

### Current Implementation Status
⚠️ **Action Required**: Competition statistics currently visible on public competition pages at `/competitions/[slug]` need to be moved to admin-only areas.
