# Sports Monks Migration Retrospective

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Author**: Claude (AI Assistant)
**User Feedback**: Critical to success

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated from multiple API sources to Sports Monks as the single source of truth for football data. Migration exposed several critical issues that required user intervention to resolve.

**Key Metrics:**
- ✅ 520 fixtures synced from Sports Monks (up from 2)
- ✅ 10 competitions correctly mapped
- ✅ 46 legacy scripts archived (from 68 to 22)
- ✅ 4 legacy source files archived
- ✅ All competition logos migrated to Sports Monks CDN
- ✅ Comprehensive API documentation created

---

## What Went Wrong

### 1. **Resorted to External Sources for Data Available in API**

**Issue**: Used Wikipedia and brandfetch for competition logos when Sports Monks provides them via `image_path`.

**Root Cause**: Didn't audit API responses before implementing. Made assumptions instead of checking documentation.

**User Quote**: "Don't think like the logos come from the API itself?"

**Lesson**: **Always audit API responses first.** Create a script to document available fields before writing business logic.

### 2. **Incorrect Competition Mappings**

**Issue**: UCL fixtures displayed as "Serie A", Bundesliga as "FA Cup", etc.

**Root Cause**: `api_competition_mapping` table had completely wrong Sports Monks league IDs from initial setup.

**Impact**: User saw incorrect labels on frontend, breaking trust in the data.

**Lesson**: **Validate mappings immediately after setup.** A simple check script would have caught this.

### 3. **Wrong API Query Method**

**Issue**: Used `/fixtures/between/{from}/{to}` which returned 0-2 fixtures instead of hundreds.

**Root Cause**: Didn't understand subscription limitations and API behavior.

**User Correction**: Insisted they had Premier League access when I incorrectly concluded they didn't.

**Fix**: Changed to day-by-day `/fixtures/date/{date}` queries, which returned full data (520 fixtures).

**Lesson**: **Test multiple query approaches.** Don't conclude subscription limits without thorough testing.

### 4. **Made Wrong Assumptions About Subscription**

**Issue**: Told user they didn't have Premier League access when they clearly did.

**User Quote**: "that doesn't make sense an hour ago we had the access and now you're saying we don't and its clearly part of my tarrif"

**User Quote**: "we had it before - you are mistaken. EPL is ID 8 UCL is ID 2 for example"

**Root Cause**: Query method issue masked as subscription issue. Jumped to conclusions instead of systematic debugging.

**Lesson**: **Trust the user's knowledge of their subscription.** They know what they paid for. Don't argue, investigate.

## What Went Right

### 1. **User Caught Critical Errors**

The user's insistence that data was available forced re-investigation and led to discovering the real issues.

**Key Moments:**
- "that's not true, check our own documentation" → Led to finding 30-league subscription details
- "check again, but only look for EPL rather than all leagues" → Narrowed debugging scope
- Correctly identified they had Premier League access → Forced me to look at query method, not subscription

### 2. **Systematic Cleanup**

After identifying issues, created comprehensive cleanup:
- Documented API structure in `docs/SPORTS_MONKS_API.md`
- Archived 46 legacy scripts to `scripts/archive-legacy-20251002/`
- Removed legacy source code (TestSoccersAPIPage, SoccersApiService, etc.)
- Updated configuration to use Sports Monks CDN for all logos

### 3. **Created Proper Documentation**

- `docs/SPORTS_MONKS_API.md` - Complete API reference
- `docs/MIGRATION_RETROSPECTIVE.md` - This document
- Inline comments in sync scripts explaining query method choice

## Critical Lessons Learned

### 1. **Audit First, Code Second**

**Wrong Approach**:
```typescript
// Assume API doesn't provide logos
const logo = 'https://wikipedia.org/...';
```

**Right Approach**:
```typescript
// First: Create audit script to see what API provides
// scripts/audit-api-structure.mjs

// Then: Use API data
const logo = league.image_path; // From Sports Monks
```

### 2. **Don't Hard-Code Data That APIs Provide**

**Red Flags**:
- Linking to Wikipedia for images
- Using brandfetch for logos
- Hard-coding any data that might change
- Creating mappings without validation

**Green Flags**:
- Using API CDN URLs
- Storing API IDs for reference
- Validating mappings against API responses

### 3. **User Knowledge > AI Assumptions**

When user says "we have access to X" and AI says "you don't", the user is almost always right about:
- What they subscribed to
- What worked before
- What their documentation says

**Correct Response**: "Let me investigate why the query isn't working" not "your subscription doesn't include that"

### 4. **Test Multiple API Approaches**

Don't assume the first endpoint you try is the only option:
- ✅ Try `/fixtures/between/`
- ✅ Try `/fixtures/date/`
- ✅ Try with different include parameters
- ✅ Test with known-good data first

### 5. **Track Data Sources**

Critical for migrations:
- `data_source` column (manual, sportmonks, etc.)
- `last_synced_at` timestamps
- API IDs in separate columns (don't overwrite internal IDs)

## Migration Checklist for Future APIs

Use this checklist for any API integration:

### Phase 1: Discovery
- [ ] Read official documentation thoroughly
- [ ] Create audit script to document API response structure
- [ ] Test multiple query methods
- [ ] Check rate limits and subscription details
- [ ] Identify what data API provides vs what we need

### Phase 2: Mapping
- [ ] Create mapping tables between our IDs and API IDs
- [ ] Validate mappings with sample queries
- [ ] Document mapping logic in code comments
- [ ] Create recovery scripts for fixing bad mappings

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Use API data for everything available (images, names, etc.)
- [ ] Don't hard-code data that API provides
- [ ] Track data source in database
- [ ] Handle rate limiting properly
- [ ] Log all API errors for debugging

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Compare new data against old data
- [ ] Check frontend displays correctly
- [ ] Verify all competitions/teams mapped
- [ ] Test edge cases (missing data, API errors)
- [ ] Get user to verify data quality

### Phase 5: Cleanup
- [ ] Archive old scripts
- [ ] Remove legacy code
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide for next person

## Current State (Post-Migration)

### Database
- **520 Sports Monks fixtures** across 10 competitions
- **All competitions** have correct Sports Monks league ID mappings
- **All fixtures** have `data_source='sportmonks'` tracking
- **Teams** have Sports Monks team IDs stored

### Codebase
- **22 active scripts** (down from 68)
- **No legacy API code** in src/
- **Single data source** (Sports Monks only)
- **Comprehensive documentation**

### Frontend
- **All competition logos** from Sports Monks CDN
- **Correct competition labels** (no more UCL as "SER")
- **520 fixtures** available for display
- **Build succeeds** with no legacy code errors

---

## Future Work

### Immediate (Should Do)
1. **Sync team logos** from Sports Monks `participant.image_path`
2. **Test TV stations** sync (flag exists, needs validation)
3. **Remove `footballdata_id`** column from database
4. **Add Sports Monks logo column** to competitions table (or keep using config)

### Medium Term (Nice to Have)
1. **Live scores** from Sports Monks (flag exists, not implemented)
2. **Match state tracking** for in-progress matches
3. **Venue information** from Sports Monks
4. **Round/stage information** for better fixture grouping

### Long Term (Consider)
1. **Team metadata** from Sports Monks (founded date, stadium, etc.)
2. **Player data** (if subscription includes it)
3. **Historical results** (if needed for H2H pages)

---

## Conclusion

This migration was messier than it should have been due to:
1. Not auditing API responses before implementation
2. Making assumptions about subscription limitations
3. Hard-coding data that APIs provide
4. Not validating mappings after setup

**User feedback was critical** to success - they caught every major error and forced proper investigation.

**Key Takeaway**: When integrating any new API, spend 2-3 hours upfront auditing the API, documenting responses, and validating assumptions. This would have prevented 8+ hours of debugging and fixes.

## Credits

**User**: Caught all critical errors, insisted on proper data access, forced systematic investigation
**Claude**: Eventually got it right after multiple corrections

**Lesson**: AI should verify assumptions before implementing, especially when user contradicts them.
