## [2025-01-XX] - Major Routing Refactor

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES
- **Complete routing system refactor**: Migrated from complex dual-mode routing to simple hash-based navigation
- **All internal URLs changed**: `/football/fixtures` ‚Üí `#/fixtures`
- **Removed History API dependency**: Now works without server-side routing configuration

### ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Navigation issues**: URLs now properly sync with content updates
- **Page reload errors**: Eliminated "Cannot GET" errors on direct URL access  
- **Match card links**: Fixed missing/broken match IDs in fixture cards
- **Development vs Production**: Unified behavior across all environments
- **Click interceptor bugs**: Simplified link handling eliminates edge cases

### üîß Technical Changes  
- **Simplified parseRoute()**: Reduced from 80+ lines to 30 lines of hash parsing
- **Simplified navigate()**: Now just sets `location.hash`, no History API complexity
- **Hash-only event handling**: Uses `hashchange` events exclusively
- **Link generation**: All internal links now generate `#/` URLs
- **Removed DEV_HASH detection**: No more environment-specific routing logic

### üìà Improvements
- **Reliability**: Hash routing works in all environments without configuration
- **Performance**: Eliminated complex route parsing and URL manipulation
- **Maintainability**: Much simpler codebase with fewer edge cases
- **Local development**: Works with file:// protocol and any local server
- **SEO compatibility**: Server redirects still work with Netlify fallback

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Single routing mode**: Hash-based navigation (`#/fixtures`, `#/clubs`, etc.)
- **No server dependencies**: Works with any static file server
- **Simplified debugging**: Clear separation between hash parsing and view rendering
- **Future-proof**: Resistant to server configuration changes
