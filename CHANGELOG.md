## [2025-09-09] - SPA stability + UI polish

### Fixed
- Local preview stuck on "loading‚Ä¶" caused by an unclosed `<script type="module">` tag. Added closing `</script>`, `</body>`, `</html>`.
- Router crash due to missing optional views (about/how-to-watch/weekend/team-guides). Added safe stubs so routes always resolve.
- Removed invalid `<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options">` which must be set via HTTP header (Netlify/Toml), silencing console warnings.

### Added
- Centralized data helpers in `index.html`: `jget()`, `loadTeams()`, `loadFixtures()` with Supabase auth headers and fallbacks.
- Blackout UI: red disabled button for confirmed blackout (`data-is-blackout="true"`) with tooltip "No TV broadcast (UK blackout)".
- Competition badge: EPL pill replaced with Premier League logo-only badge on match cards.
 - Match page hero layout with larger crests/title, right-side meta (kickoff, venue, competition badge), responsive providers grid, and breadcrumb trail.
 - Clickable team names on match page linking to team pages.

### Changed
- Kept yellow "Broadcast TBC" styling for unknown broadcasts; blackout now visually distinct but consistent opacity.
 - Breadcrumbs now use slash separators: `Football / Premier League / Matchweek N`, with a Back link row underneath.

### Notes
- Blackout logic remains localStorage-based and does not write placeholder provider rows to the database.

## [2025-01-XX] - Major Routing Refactor + Data Filtering

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES
- **Complete routing system refactor**: Migrated from complex dual-mode routing to simple hash-based navigation
- **All internal URLs changed**: `/football/fixtures` ‚Üí `#/fixtures`
- **Removed History API dependency**: Now works without server-side routing configuration

### ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Navigation issues**: URLs now properly sync with content updates
- **Page reload errors**: Eliminated "Cannot GET" errors on direct URL access  
- **Match card links**: Fixed missing/broken match IDs in fixture cards
- **Development vs Production**: Unified behavior across all environments
- **Click interceptor bugs**: Simplified link handling eliminates edge cases
- **Test fixture data**: Implemented dual-layer filtering to exclude test fixtures
- **Data consistency**: All views now use consistent filtered data source

### üîß Technical Changes  
- **Simplified parseRoute()**: Reduced from 80+ lines to 30 lines of hash parsing
- **Simplified navigate()**: Now just sets `location.hash`, no History API complexity
- **Hash-only event handling**: Uses `hashchange` events exclusively
- **Link generation**: All internal links now generate `#/` URLs
- **Removed DEV_HASH detection**: No more environment-specific routing logic
- **Centralized data loading**: All fixture queries go through `loadFixtures()` function
- **Dual-layer filtering**: Database query filtering + backup ID filtering
- **Season-aware queries**: Only load fixtures from current season (2024-08-01+)
- **Matchday validation**: Filter for valid Premier League matchdays (1-38)

### üìà Improvements
- **Reliability**: Hash routing works in all environments without configuration
- **Performance**: Eliminated complex route parsing and URL manipulation
- **Maintainability**: Much simpler codebase with fewer edge cases
- **Local development**: Works with file:// protocol and any local server
- **SEO compatibility**: Server redirects still work with Netlify fallback

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Single routing mode**: Hash-based navigation (`#/fixtures`, `#/clubs`, etc.)
- **No server dependencies**: Works with any static file server
- **Simplified debugging**: Clear separation between hash parsing and view rendering
- **Future-proof**: Resistant to server configuration changes
