        <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
              <p>
                Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a commission when you make a purchase
                through our recommendations. When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, the company pays
                us a small percentage of your purchase price at no extra cost to you.
