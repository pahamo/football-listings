Why We Migrated
Primary Issue: The single-file SPA architecture became unreliable for AI-assisted development

Changes to one feature frequently broke unrelated functionality
Hash-based routing was fragile and error-prone
Manual DOM manipulation led to state management issues
No isolation between features made debugging difficult
Solution: React provides:

Component isolation (changes contained within components)
Predictable patterns that AI tools understand better
Type safety with TypeScript
Proper state management
Standard routing with React Router
Database Architecture
Backend: Supabase (unchanged)

Same database schema and data
Same API endpoints
Admin workflow preserved
Key Tables:

fixtures - Match data
teams - Team information
broadcasts - Broadcaster assignments
providers - Sky Sports, TNT Sports, etc.
Views Used:

fixtures_with_teams - Fixtures with team data joined
Recent Changes (comprehensive match day experience + fixtures management)

**Latest Update (SEO Enhancement & Production Readiness)**:
- **SEO-Friendly Match URLs**: Implemented descriptive URLs like `/matches/123-arsenal-vs-chelsea-2025-09-13` for better search visibility
- **Dynamic Meta Tags**: Page-specific titles, descriptions, and Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD markup for SportsEvent, Organization, and Website schemas to enable rich search results
- **Canonical URLs**: Proper canonical tags on all pages to prevent duplicate content issues
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy URLs `/match/:id` still supported while new SEO URLs are preferred
- **Social Media Integration**: Open Graph tags include team crests and match details for rich social sharing

**Previous Updates (beta content + admin stability)**:
- Admin page stability: fixed StrictMode double-mount loading issue, added safe cleanup for message timers, and guarded state updates after unmount
- Admin UX: detects pending changes, inline "Save" per row, refresh confirmation when there are unsaved edits, disabled controls during save, success/error messaging
- Simple data service: replaced PostgREST-style JOINs with a robust two-step fetch (fixtures ‚Üí team names ‚Üí broadcasts), added dynamic season window (Aug 1 of season year)
- New pages: About page with project overview; Teams index grid; Team page with upcoming fixtures and a simple "How to watch" section
- Routing updates: added routes for `/clubs` and `/clubs/:slug`; legacy `/club/:clubId` still supported

Bug Tracker (Beta)

- Provider mismatch across pages (Fixed, verified)
  - Symptom: Admin/home show TNT or Sky, but match page showed "TBC".
  - Root cause: Providers table may be incomplete or missing some columns (e.g., `url`, `slug`), causing the providers lookup to fail.
  - Fix: Adjusted provider query to only select existing columns; added robust fallback mapping for UK providers (ID 1 = Sky, 2 = TNT) so match page shows correct broadcaster even if the table is sparse.
  - Files: src/services/supabase.ts

- Missing blackout option in Admin (Fixed, verified)
  - Symptom: No way to mark fixtures as UK blackout from admin.
  - Solution: Added "üö´ Blackout (No UK TV)" option; saving sets/removes localStorage blackout flag and clears broadcaster rows.
  - Files: src/pages/AdminPage.tsx, src/services/supabase-simple.ts

- Back to Schedule not visible on Match page (Fixed)
  - Added clear "‚Üê Back to Schedule" link under details.
  - File: src/pages/MatchPage.tsx

- Admin stuck on Loading (Fixed)
  - Cause: StrictMode double-mount guards blocked state updates.
  - Fix: Reset isMounted flag on mount, cleanup timers on unmount.
  - File: src/pages/AdminPage.tsx

- Netlify deployment (Completed)
  - netlify.toml builds the React app (base=react-version, publish=build) with SPA redirect.
  - Site live at: https://fixturesapp.netlify.app/
  - Env vars set: REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL, REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - Build command uses `CI=` to prevent CRA warning-as-error in CI.
  - Files: netlify.toml, config/netlify.toml

- Supabase credentials fallback (Security hardening)
  - Change: Removed hardcoded fallback URL/key from client; env is required now.
  - Impact: Local dev must have `react-version/.env`; Netlify must have env vars.
  - File: src/services/supabase.ts

- 404 Handling (UX improvement)
  - Added NotFound route with links back to key pages.
  - Files: src/pages/NotFoundPage.tsx, src/App.tsx

Deployment

- Live URL: https://fixturesapp.netlify.app/
- Platform: Netlify
- Build settings (from netlify.toml):
  - base: react-version
  - command: CI= npm run build
  - publish: build
  - redirect: /* ‚Üí /index.html (status 200)
- Environment variables:
  - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
  - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - Optional: NODE_VERSION=18 or 20
- Notes:
  - Local dev also uses react-version/.env (ignored by git).
  - Consider rotating Supabase anon key and removing inline fallbacks in services once env is everywhere.

Compliance, Security & Legal (New)

- Security headers (Netlify):
  - HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, baseline CSP applied to all routes.
  - File: netlify.toml (mirrored in config/netlify.toml).
- Robots and indexing controls:
  - X-Robots-Tag: noindex for /admin/* and /api/private/*
  - Staging (deploy previews/branch deploys) send global X-Robots-Tag: noindex
  - robots.txt disallows /admin and /api/private and points to /sitemap.xml
- Sitemaps:
  - Generated at build time: /sitemap.xml + child sitemaps in /sitemaps (fixtures, matches, teams, providers, legal)
  - Script: react-version/scripts/generate_sitemaps.mjs (runs in prebuild)
  - Env: REACT_APP_CANONICAL_BASE used for canonical URLs
- Canonical handling:
  - All SEO meta generators use REACT_APP_CANONICAL_BASE
  - Legal pages set canonical to current URL
- Legal pages (plain‚ÄëEnglish boilerplate + TODOs):
  - Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Terms & Conditions under /legal/*
  - Provider pages /providers/:slug render required affiliate disclosures
  - Privacy request path: /privacy/request (email/type/message + data‚Äësubject confirm; mailto fallback)
- Cookies:
  - Minimal Cookie Settings modal (informational MVP). Necessary locked on; analytics cookie‚Äëless on; marketing disabled
  - Footer ‚ÄúCookie settings‚Äù opens modal; future CMP can replace this
- Affiliate disclosure:
  - Inline above CTAs and footer disclosure on match and provider pages; affiliate links carry aria‚Äëlabels and rel="sponsored"

Secrets hygiene

- Removed tracked .env files from repo and added ignore for config/.env
  - Rotated Supabase anon key recommended
  - Production/staging rely on Netlify env: REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL, REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, REACT_APP_CANONICAL_BASE

Verification checklist (post‚Äëdeploy)

- Headers:
  - curl -I https://<host>/ | grep -i "strict-transport\|content-security\|referrer-policy\|permissions-policy"
  - curl -I https://<host>/admin | grep -i x-robots
  - curl -I https://<host>/fixtures | grep -i content-security
- Sitemaps & robots:
  - https://<host>/sitemap.xml and child sitemaps return 200
  - https://<host>/robots.txt lists sitemap and disallows sensitive routes
- Pages:
  - /, /fixtures, /clubs, /clubs/:slug, /matches/:slug, /providers/:slug, /admin
  - /legal/privacy-policy, /legal/cookie-policy, /legal/terms
  - /privacy/request submits and opens mailto; SLA text shows
- CSP:
  - Check browser console for any CSP violations; extend directives narrowly if needed

Launch Branding Plan (Match Locator)

- Product name at launch: Match Locator
- Primary domain at launch: matchlocator.com (not live yet)
- Current staging site: https://fixturesapp.netlify.app/
- Current in-app branding: "fixtures.app" (logo + header). This will be updated prior to launch.

Planned changes for rebrand (no code changes made yet):
- Update visible product name:
  - Header title text in `react-version/src/components/Header.tsx`
  - Any page copy that mentions "fixtures.app"
- Update SEO/meta:
  - Page title/description in `react-version/public/index.html`
  - Manifest app name/short_name in `react-version/public/manifest.json`
  - Canonical/OG tags or JSON-LD generators (if/when added) to point to `https://matchlocator.com`
- Assets:
  - Replace logo at `react-version/public/logo.svg` if new brand mark is provided
- Deployment:
  - Add custom domain `matchlocator.com` in Netlify ‚Üí Domain management
  - Point DNS (A/ALIAS/CNAME) to Netlify, enable HTTPS
  - After cutover, verify deep-link refresh works on the custom domain
Supabase keys currently hardcoded in services (move to env)
In Progress
Stripping down to minimal working version
Removing problematic inherited features
Building up features incrementally
Implementing match detail pages and linking from fixtures
Development Workflow
Running the Applications
Original SPA (backup version):

Open index.html directly or use Live Server
Admin interface at /admin.html
React Version:

bash
cd react-version
npm install
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:3000 (or next available port e.g. 3001)
# Admin at /admin; Teams index at /clubs; Team pages at /clubs/:slug; About at /about
AI-Assisted Development Guidelines
With React version:

Changes should be more contained and predictable
Component isolation reduces breaking changes
TypeScript provides error catching
Test individual components before integration
Best Practices:

Make small, incremental changes
Test immediately after each AI-generated change
Use git commits as checkpoints
Focus on one feature at a time
Database Connection
Supabase Configuration:

typescript
// In services/supabase.ts
const supabaseUrl = 'https://[project-id].supabase.co'
const supabaseKey = '[anon-key]'
API Patterns:

Use JOIN queries instead of complex views when possible
Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
Implement loading states for better UX
For admin/simple views, prefer simple table queries and follow-up lookups over embedded joins (more portable across environments)
Key Learnings
Architecture Decisions:

React's component model works better with AI assistance
TypeScript catches errors before they reach production
Proper routing eliminates hash-based URL issues
File separation makes debugging easier
Migration Strategy:

Keep original version as backup during migration
Build features incrementally rather than all at once
Strip problematic features and rebuild cleanly
Test each component independently
Admin Interface Notes

Summary of fixes and behavior:

- Dropdown Logic: robust handling of empty/null broadcaster states
- Pending Changes: detects when selection differs from current assignment
- Save UX: per-row save button, disabled while saving, success/error messages
- Loading and Unmount Safety: guards to avoid state updates after unmount; resolves StrictMode loading hang
- Refresh Behavior: prompts when unsaved changes exist; clears stale pending state on reload

Data service specifics (simple mode):

- Fixtures: `fixtures` table only (`id, utc_kickoff, home_team_id, away_team_id`)
- Team names: fetched via a single `teams` query using `.in('id', [...])`
- Broadcasts: fetched via `broadcasts` for loaded fixture IDs; mapped to Sky/TNT labels
- Season window: dynamic from Aug 1 of the current PL season (adjust if your dataset is older)

Developer Handoff Notes
For New Developers:

Focus on React version going forward
Original SPA kept for reference only
Database schema is stable and well-designed
Admin interface is critical for daily operations
Key Files:

**Core Application:**
src/components/Header.tsx - Reusable header component with logo, title, and navigation
src/services/supabase.ts - All database interactions
src/services/supabase-simple.ts - Simple admin/home fixtures + save helpers
src/pages/AdminPage.tsx - Broadcast data management (keeps original header)
src/pages/HomePage.tsx - Main fixtures display with Header component
src/pages/FixturesPage.tsx - Comprehensive fixtures page with filtering
src/pages/ClubsPage.tsx - Club grid page with team crests
src/pages/TeamsPage.tsx - Club index grid (alternative layout)
src/pages/ClubPage.tsx - Team fixtures and viewing guide
src/pages/MatchPage.tsx - Individual match details page with affiliate compliance
src/pages/AboutPage.tsx - Project overview and notes
src/types/index.ts - TypeScript definitions

**SEO & Technical:**
src/utils/seo.ts - SEO utility functions for URLs, meta tags, and canonical links
src/components/StructuredData.tsx - JSON-LD structured data for search engines
src/App.tsx - Updated routing with SEO-friendly URLs and legal pages
public/index.html - SEO meta tags, canonical link, sitemap reference
public/sitemap.xml - Search engine sitemap (if present)

**Legal & Compliance:**
src/pages/legal/PrivacyPolicy.tsx - Privacy policy page
src/pages/legal/CookiePolicy.tsx - Cookie policy page
src/pages/legal/Terms.tsx - Terms of service page
src/components/legal/AffiliateDisclosure.tsx - Affiliate link compliance
src/components/Footer.tsx - Site footer with legal links

**Assets & Configuration:**
public/logo.svg - fixtures.app SVG logo icon
public/manifest.json - PWA manifest with fixtures.app details
Common Issues:

**Database & API:**
- Database view inconsistencies between environments
- Column name mismatches in queries
- API rate limiting with Supabase free tier
- If no fixtures render on admin: check season date window and team FK IDs; optionally remove date filter for debugging

**SEO & Routing:**
- SEO URLs work in dev but 404 in production: ensure Netlify redirects are configured (`/* /index.html 200`)
- Meta tags not updating on navigation: check that `updateDocumentMeta()` is called in useEffect
- Structured data validation errors: use Google's Rich Results Test tool to verify JSON-LD
- Canonical URLs pointing to wrong domain: verify `REACT_APP_CANONICAL_BASE` environment variable

**Legal & Compliance:**
- Affiliate disclosures not appearing: check `AffiliateDisclosure` component placement in match pages
- Cookie settings not functional: placeholder implementation needs cookie management integration
Contact & Feedback
This migration was driven by practical development challenges with AI-assisted coding in the original architecture. The React version should provide a more maintainable foundation for future development.
