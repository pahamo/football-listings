# Claude Code SEO Implementation Prompt

## Context
I'm building a sports fixtures website that shows Premier League fans which UK broadcasters are showing each match. The MVP is focused on Premier League + UK only, with plans to expand to other sports and territories.

**Current Setup:**
- Tech Stack: Supabase (Postgres) + Single Page App (index.html) + Netlify hosting
- GitHub: https://github.com/pahamo/football-listings
- Live Site: https://football-listings.netlify.app/
- Database: Teams, fixtures, providers, broadcasts_uk tables already set up

## SEO Implementation Tasks

### 1. Meta Data & HTML Structure
**Implement comprehensive meta tags for:**
- Dynamic page titles based on content (fixtures, teams, matches)
- Meta descriptions that include key terms like "Premier League", "TV schedule", "UK broadcasters"
- Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Twitter Cards for Twitter sharing
- Schema.org structured data for sports events and organizations

**Key pages to optimize:**
- Homepage: `/` or `/football/premier-league/fixtures`
- Individual match pages: `/football/matches/{match-id-slug}`
- Team pages: `/football/teams/{team-slug}`
- Competition overview: `/football/premier-league/`

### 2. URL Structure & Routing
**Transform current hash-based routing to SEO-friendly URLs:**
- Implement proper URL structure with meaningful slugs
- Ensure URLs include sport hierarchy: `/football/premier-league/...`
- Add canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content
- Implement proper 404 handling for invalid routes

### 3. Content Structure & Semantic HTML
**Optimize HTML structure for search engines:**
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Implement semantic HTML5 elements (main, section, article, aside)
- Add proper alt text for team crests and logos
- Use structured lists for fixtures and team information
- Implement breadcrumb navigation

### 4. Performance & Core Web Vitals
**Optimize for page speed and user experience:**
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize database queries to reduce load times
- Add proper caching headers
- Implement service worker for offline functionality (optional)

### 5. Sitemap & Robots.txt
**Create automated sitemap generation:**
- Dynamic sitemap.xml that updates with new fixtures
- Include all key pages (teams, matches, competition pages)
- Add robots.txt with proper crawling instructions
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

### 6. Local SEO & Rich Snippets
**Implement sports-specific structured data:**
- SportsEvent schema for individual matches
- SportsTeam schema for team pages
- Organization schema for broadcasters
- BreadcrumbList schema for navigation

## Technical Requirements

### Database Integration
The app uses Supabase with these key tables:
- `teams` (id, name, slug, crest_url)
- `fixtures` (id, date, home_team_id, away_team_id, matchweek)
- `providers` (id, name, type, logo_url)
- `broadcasts_uk` (fixture_id, provider_id, channel)

### Frontend Constraints
- Must remain a single HTML file SPA for simplicity
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks for MVP)
- Keep bundle size minimal for fast loading
- Mobile-responsive design required

### Monetization Considerations
- Affiliate links to broadcasters must be properly tagged
- Ensure affiliate buttons don't hurt SEO performance
- Balance monetization with user experience

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Enhanced index.html** with:
   - Proper meta tag management system
   - SEO-friendly routing implementation
   - Structured data integration
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Supporting files:**
   - robots.txt
   - sitemap.xml generation logic
   - .htaccess or _redirects for Netlify

3. **Documentation:**
   - SEO checklist for future content

   - Instructions for ongoing SEO maintenance
