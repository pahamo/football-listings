Why We Migrated
Primary Issue: The single-file SPA architecture became unreliable for AI-assisted development

Changes to one feature frequently broke unrelated functionality
Hash-based routing was fragile and error-prone
Manual DOM manipulation led to state management issues
No isolation between features made debugging difficult
Solution: React provides:

Component isolation (changes contained within components)
Predictable patterns that AI tools understand better
Type safety with TypeScript
Proper state management
Standard routing with React Router
Database Architecture
Backend: Supabase (unchanged)

Same database schema and data
Same API endpoints
Admin workflow preserved
Key Tables:

fixtures - Match data
teams - Team information
broadcasts - Broadcaster assignments
providers - Sky Sports, TNT Sports, etc.
Views Used:

fixtures_with_teams - Fixtures with team data joined
Recent Changes (comprehensive match day experience + fixtures management)

**Latest Update (fixtures.app Branding & Unified Header)**:
- **Complete Rebranding to fixtures.app**: Site now branded as "fixtures.app" with custom logo and consistent identity
- **Unified Header Navigation**: Created reusable Header component used across all pages (except admin)
- **Custom Logo Design**: SVG football icon with gradient styling and professional appearance
- **Consistent Navigation Bar**: Right-aligned navigation menu with hover effects and proper responsive behavior
- **Brand Identity**: Updated HTML titles, meta descriptions, manifest.json with fixtures.app branding
- **Theme Colors**: Applied brand purple (#6366f1) throughout site with consistent color scheme
- **Header Component Architecture**: Flexible header with logo, main title ("fixtures.app"), and optional page subtitles

**Previous Update (Match Day Experience)**:
- **Match Day Home Page**: Completely redesigned home page to show current/upcoming match day with smart date detection
- **Comprehensive Fixtures Page**: New `/fixtures` page with advanced filtering by team, matchweek, competition, and viewing location
- **Clubs Grid Page**: Beautiful responsive grid showing all 20 Premier League teams with official crests
- **Database Schema Fixes**: Resolved column name mismatches (`teams.crest_url`, `fixtures_with_teams` structure)
- **Supabase Client Consolidation**: Eliminated multiple client warnings by sharing single instance
- **Full Navigation Integration**: Complete interconnected navigation between all pages
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Live stats showing TV/streaming/blackout/TBD fixture counts
- **Visual Enhancements**: Team crests, match day indicators, responsive layouts, provider type icons

**Previous Updates (beta content + admin stability)**:
- Admin page stability: fixed StrictMode double-mount loading issue, added safe cleanup for message timers, and guarded state updates after unmount
- Admin UX: detects pending changes, inline "Save" per row, refresh confirmation when there are unsaved edits, disabled controls during save, success/error messaging
- Simple data service: replaced PostgREST-style JOINs with a robust two-step fetch (fixtures → team names → broadcasts), added dynamic season window (Aug 1 of season year)
- New pages: About page with project overview; Teams index grid; Team page with upcoming fixtures and a simple "How to watch" section
- Routing updates: added routes for `/clubs` and `/clubs/:slug`; legacy `/club/:clubId` still supported
- Navigation: added header links on the homepage (Clubs, About, Admin)
Migration Status

In Progress
Stripping down to minimal working version
Removing problematic inherited features
Building up features incrementally
Implementing match detail pages and linking from fixtures
Development Workflow
Running the Applications
Original SPA (backup version):

Open index.html directly or use Live Server
Admin interface at /admin.html
React Version:

bash
cd react-version
npm install
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:3000 (or next available port e.g. 3001)
# Admin at /admin; Teams index at /clubs; Team pages at /clubs/:slug; About at /about
AI-Assisted Development Guidelines
With React version:

Changes should be more contained and predictable
Component isolation reduces breaking changes
TypeScript provides error catching
Test individual components before integration
Best Practices:

Make small, incremental changes
Test immediately after each AI-generated change
Use git commits as checkpoints
Focus on one feature at a time
Database Connection
Supabase Configuration:

typescript
// In services/supabase.ts
const supabaseUrl = 'https://[project-id].supabase.co'
const supabaseKey = '[anon-key]'
API Patterns:

Use JOIN queries instead of complex views when possible
Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
Implement loading states for better UX
For admin/simple views, prefer simple table queries and follow-up lookups over embedded joins (more portable across environments)
Key Learnings
Architecture Decisions:

React's component model works better with AI assistance
TypeScript catches errors before they reach production
Proper routing eliminates hash-based URL issues
File separation makes debugging easier
Migration Strategy:

Keep original version as backup during migration
Build features incrementally rather than all at once
Strip problematic features and rebuild cleanly
Test each component independently
Admin Interface Notes

Summary of fixes and behavior:

- Dropdown Logic: robust handling of empty/null broadcaster states
- Pending Changes: detects when selection differs from current assignment
- Save UX: per-row save button, disabled while saving, success/error messages
- Loading and Unmount Safety: guards to avoid state updates after unmount; resolves StrictMode loading hang
- Refresh Behavior: prompts when unsaved changes exist; clears stale pending state on reload

Data service specifics (simple mode):

- Fixtures: `fixtures` table only (`id, utc_kickoff, home_team_id, away_team_id`)
- Team names: fetched via a single `teams` query using `.in('id', [...])`
- Broadcasts: fetched via `broadcasts` for loaded fixture IDs; mapped to Sky/TNT labels
- Season window: dynamic from Aug 1 of the current PL season (adjust if your dataset is older)
Future Development
Next Steps:

Complete minimal working version
Add features back incrementally
Implement proper testing
Consider adding more competitions (FA Cup, etc.)
Implement match detail page `/matches/:id` using `getFixtureById`
Link fixture cards to match details
Move Supabase URL/key to env (`REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`, `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
Unify broadcaster constants and consider reintroducing blackout option
Prep Netlify build for React app (`react-version/build`) and SPA redirects
Expansion Considerations:

Multi-sport support (original vision)
Multiple territories (US, EU)
Advanced filtering and search
Mobile app wrapper
Developer Handoff Notes
For New Developers:

Focus on React version going forward
Original SPA kept for reference only
Database schema is stable and well-designed
Admin interface is critical for daily operations
Key Files:

src/components/Header.tsx - Reusable header component with logo, title, and navigation
src/services/supabase.ts - All database interactions
src/services/supabase-simple.ts - Simple admin/home fixtures + save helpers
src/pages/AdminPage.tsx - Broadcast data management (keeps original header)
src/pages/HomePage.tsx - Main fixtures display with Header component
src/pages/FixturesPage.tsx - Comprehensive fixtures page with filtering
src/pages/ClubsPage.tsx - Club grid page with team crests
src/pages/TeamsPage.tsx - Club index grid (alternative layout)
src/pages/ClubPage.tsx - Team fixtures and viewing guide
src/pages/MatchPage.tsx - Individual match details page
src/pages/AboutPage.tsx - Project overview and notes
src/types/index.ts - TypeScript definitions
public/logo.svg - fixtures.app SVG logo icon
public/index.html - Updated with fixtures.app branding
public/manifest.json - PWA manifest with fixtures.app details
Common Issues:

Database view inconsistencies between environments
Column name mismatches in queries
API rate limiting with Supabase free tier
If no fixtures render on admin: check season date window and team FK IDs; optionally remove date filter for debugging
